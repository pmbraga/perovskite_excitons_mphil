# Excitons in layered perovskite solar cells - suplementary code
## BCN: HYOCP

Code associated with the production of the written assignment submitted to the MPhil in Scientific Computing at the Univeristy of Cambridge, Cavendish laboratory.

Simulations performed to solve the Wannier equation numerically to produce binding energies and eigenvectors of excitons in Bis(phenylethylammonium) lead iodide perovskite crystals.

No additional data is required and the solutions produced by the file `binding_energy.ipynb` for the file lowest energy states are available in the "excitonic_states" folder to help with result reproducibility.

Note: paths to these files might need change.
